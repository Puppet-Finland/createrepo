ADDING THE REPOSITORY FILE

You also need to download a yum repo file so that yum can find these packages:

$ cd /etc/yum.repos.d
$ wget http://<%= fqdn %>/repos/yum/conf/<%= fqdn %>-<%= reponame %>.repo


INSTALLING PACKAGES

In most cases, this is as simple as

$ yum install <packagename>

You need to allow importing the repository's public GPG key when you tells you 
to.
